# Chemist-Shops
A program for chemist shops where you can log in as either a chemist or a customer and view or update the inventory of stocked medicines.

Purpose:
We see many patients going from shop to shop, looking for essential medicines. Sometimes thereâ€™s an emergency and the chemist may not have that medicine in stock. This program helps them to find the chemists who have the required quantity of the medicine, along with its opening/closing time and location. The list of those chemists is printed in the ascending order of the distance from the customer.

Usage:
Run the code and press 'm' while using for the first time to make the file. 
Run the code again and press 'u' to use the file.
Choose if you are a customer or a chemist and follow the given instructions in the input statements.
